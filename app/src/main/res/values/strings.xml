    <string name="desc">Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin\'s standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.</string>
    <string name="desc_more">On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers. As a result many developers have switched to Kotlin. Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 6 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 8 up to 15, for optimization, or allows for more features, e.g. Java 8 related with Kotlin 1.4, and has experimental record class support for Java 16 compatibility.\'s standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.</string>
